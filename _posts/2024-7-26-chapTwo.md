title: Parallel Programming in CUDA C
---

This post is about learning one of the fundamental ways CUDA exposes its parallelism

For writting a program that adds two vectors we will follow the approach that we had defined prevously, first create memory in gpu and then allocate it, run the kernal and then copy the memory back to cpu and then show the results. We need to understand that we can generate any number of threaads and blocks using cuda so say that we have vector of size N then, 

`#define N 10
kernel<<<N, 1>>>`

but remember the value of launched blocks dimensions cant exceed 65535, its a hard limit imposed by the hardware

## Julia set

Julia set  evaluates a simple iterative equationfor points in a plane. 
- A point is *not* in the set if the process of iterating equation diverges for that point. 
- If the sequence of values produced by interating the equation grows towards inf. then its considered *outside* the set

we shall consider following equation:
`Zn+1 = Zn*Zn + C`
