I am writing this blog to get things clear and set up the path for months ahead. My primary goal is going to be preparing for the GATE examination for Masters. But since I have developed interest in computer graphics and have spent some time in it I will be spending an hour studying it. More like a recreation study session. This blog lays down the approach that I will be following and what is going to be my main focus. After reading rants and discussions on hacker news and reddit, I have concluded that the theory is way more important than the understanding of an API. So rather than focusing on APIs like OpenGL and DX 11, my blogs will be more about the theory of how things are done. The materials that I will be using are 

1. Tiger Book
2. RTR book
3. Primer for Maths Book
4. ScratchPixel Blogs
5. Casey's video on Ray tracing 
6. GPU gems
7. RT gems

If I have some more time to spare you may find notes of MIT OCW and Sam Yeuleck of UoU lectures. Once we have a firm understanding of the 3D fundamentals, we shall start learning and API. Although there is still time for that I am thinking of using DX12 but maybe by that time DX13 may have rolled out. 

Maybe the ray tracing blogs will contain some code as they don't require knowledge of an API but once we start GPU gems again our focus will be on the theory. You may also find some posts on Computer Performance and architecture, C++ (Focused on the language and not on implementing the rendering pipeline.) and Algorithms and Data Structures.
