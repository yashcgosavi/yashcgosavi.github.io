**Projects**

**Brain Tumor Detection Model**

- Developed and implemented a custom 3D UNet model for brain tumor segmentation using TensorFlow.
- Evaluated the model on the BraTS 2020 dataset to provide insights for medical professionals.
- Utilized dice loss and focal loss functions for model training and fine-tuning.
- Explored and compared various semantic segmentation models, including UniverSeg, FCT, and MedSAM.
- Proposed future work involving the application of deep learning architectures like UNet, VNet, and encoder-decoder networks for tumor segmentation.

**Intelligent Surveillance and Crowd Management System for Indian Railways**

- Proposed and implemented a cost-effective solution for enhancing security on Indian Railways using Facial Recognition Systems (FRS) independently of existing CCTV infrastructure, reducing the need for costly camera replacements and dependence on foreign servers.
- Addressed visibility challenges and radial distortion in CCTV footage through preprocessing techniques
- Utilized Anomaly Detection models to identify anomalies in individual behavior within crowds, enhancing frame resolution and retrieving information from databases for further action.
- Developed a system for real-time processing of both CCTV and Satellite feeds, converting them into video frames, and utilizing YOLOv5 for analytics and visualization.
