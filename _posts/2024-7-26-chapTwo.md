title: Parallel Programming in CUDA C
---

This post is about learning one of the fundamental ways CUDA exposes its parallelism

For writting a program that adds two vectors we will follow the approach that we had defined prevously, first create memory in gpu and then allocate it, run the kernal and then copy the memory back to cpu and then show the results. We need to understand that we can generate any number of threaads and blocks using cuda so say that we have vector of size N then, 

`#define N 10
kernel<<<N, 1>>>`

but remember the value of launched blocks dimensions cant exceed 65535, its a hard limit imposed by the hardware

## Julia set

Julia set  evaluates a simple iterative equationfor points in a plane. 
- A point is *not* in the set if the process of iterating equation diverges for that point. 
- If the sequence of values produced by interating the equation grows towards inf. then its considered *outside* the set

we shall consider following equation:
`Zn+1 = Zn*Zn + C`

We will be creating a bitmap to show our image. Then the pointer of this bitmap will be passed to our kernel which will populate it such that it shall show a Julia set and then dislay it. This shall be our `main()` routine.

The `kernel()` routine will just go through the pixels of the bitmap and call `julia()` function on each of the pixel co ordinates if they are the part of julia set then it shall return 1, else return 0. The color encoding is RGBA so we want all to be visible so A will be 255 across all the pixels and we will set R as output of `julia()`

The important part of this program is `julia()` function. Right now the values of x and y ranges from 0 to DIM. But we want our values in the range of [-1, 1] with center at (0, 0) and not (DIM/2, DIM/2). We will achive this by 

`x = (DIM/2 -x)
x = x/(DIM/2)`

Then in order to zoom in or zoom out there shall be a scale parameter. Then we have to take any complex number constant. After that we shall interate over each pixel and calculate if its coordinates are part of julia set or not. In order to deal with complex number, there shall be `struct cuComplex{}`

In this structure we shall be implementing a constructor where we will expect two input paramete(real, imaginary) as well as implement mutiplication and addition

Below you can find the code for simple program which solely runs on host.
```
#include "common/book.h"
#include "common/cpu_bitmap.h"

#define DIM 500

struct cuComplex
{
    float r, i;
    cuComplex(float a, float b): r(a), i(b)
    {}

    float magnitude2(void) 
    {
        return r*r + i*i;
    }
    
    cuComplex operator+(const cuComplex&a)
    {
        return cuComplex(r+a.r, i+a.i );
    }

    cuComplex operator*(const cuComplex&a)
    {
        return cuComplex(r*a.r - i*a.i, i*a.r + r*a.i );
    }

};

int julia(int x, int y)
{
    float scale = 1.5;
    float jx = scale*(float)(DIM/2 - x)/(DIM/2);
    float jy = scale*(float)(DIM/2 - y)/(DIM/2);

    cuComplex c(-0.8, 0.156);
    cuComplex a(jx, jy);

    for(int i = 0; i < 200; i++)
    {
        a = a*a + c;
        if (a.magnitude2() > 1000)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return 1;
}

void kernel(unsigned char* ptr)
{
    for(int y = 0;y<DIM; y++)
    {
        for(int x = 0; x<DIM; x++)
        {
            int offset = x+y*DIM;
            int val = julia(x, y);
            ptr[offset*4+0] = 255*val;
            ptr[offset*4+1] = 0;
            ptr[offset*4+2] = 0;
            ptr[offset*4+3] = 255;
        }
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    CPUBitmap bitmap(DIM, DIM);
    unsigned char* ptr = bitmap.get_ptr();
    kernel(ptr);
    bitmap.display_and_exit();
}
```

There is the [output](https://youtu.be/-GNj-D9t4fI) note the time taken: 174ms. Now all that we have to do is use the power of GPU. For that first we have to qualify our kernel with `__global__` qualifier. All the functions which will be called by the kernel and the code runned by device will be quilified by `__device__`. Now we know that cuda allows the thread and blocks to of 3D. We shall be making DIM, DIM blocks and each block shall have one thread. Hence for each pixel a single thread shall be spunned up. Once the kernel has calculated and populated the bitmap in the device memory we will be copying it to the bitmap present in our host memory and then deleting it with `cudaFree()`. 

```c
#include "common/book.h"
#include "common/cpu_bitmap.h"

#define DIM 500

struct cuComplex
{
    float r, i;
    __device__ cuComplex(float a, float b): r(a), i(b)
    {}

    __device__ float magnitude2(void) 
    {
        return r*r + i*i;
    }
    
    __device__ cuComplex operator+(const cuComplex&a)
    {
        return cuComplex(r+a.r, i+a.i );
    }

    __device__ cuComplex operator*(const cuComplex&a)
    {
        return cuComplex(r*a.r - i*a.i, i*a.r + r*a.i );
    }

};

__device__ 
int julia(int x, int y)
{
    float scale = 1.5;
    float jx = scale*(float)(DIM/2 - x)/(DIM/2);
    float jy = scale*(float)(DIM/2 - y)/(DIM/2);

    cuComplex c(-0.8, 0.156);
    cuComplex a(jx, jy);

    for(int i = 0; i < 200; i++)
    {
        a = a*a + c;
        if (a.magnitude2() > 1000)
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }

    return 1;
}

__global__
void kernel(unsigned char* dev_bitmap)
{
    int x = blockIdx.x;
    int y = blockIdx.y;

    int offset = x+y*gridDim.x;

    int val = julia(x, y);
    dev_bitmap[offset*4+0] = 255*val;
    dev_bitmap[offset*4+1] = 0;
    dev_bitmap[offset*4+2] = 0;
    dev_bitmap[offset*4+3] = 255;
}
struct  DataBlock
{
    unsigned char* dev_bitmap;
};

int main(void)
{
    DataBlock data;
    CPUBitmap bitmap(DIM, DIM, &data);
    unsigned char* dev_bitmap;
    cudaMalloc((void**) &dev_bitmap, bitmap.image_size());
    data.dev_bitmap = dev_bitmap;
    clock_t start, stop;
    dim3 grid(DIM, DIM);
    start = clock();
    kernel<<<grid, 1>>>(dev_bitmap);
    stop = clock();
    cudaMemcpy(bitmap.get_ptr(), dev_bitmap, bitmap.image_size(), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    cudaFree(dev_bitmap);
    float time = (float) (stop - start)/
                (float) CLOCKS_PER_SEC*1000.0f;
    printf("Time: %3.1f ms\n", time);
    bitmap.display_and_exit();
}
```

This is  my [output](). Notice the execution time its 0.1ms!, since every pixel had its own thread.
